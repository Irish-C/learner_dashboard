* **Analytics:** Area to explore and analyze learner-related data (currently a placeholder).
* **Help:** Provides guidance and information about using the application (currently a placeholder).
* **Settings:** Allows users to configure application settings (currently a placeholder).
* **Collapsible Sidebar:** A navigation sidebar that can be collapsed for more screen real estate.
* **Icon Support:** Utilizes `dash-iconify` for a wide range of icons in the sidebar menu.
* **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Dash:** A Python framework for building analytical web applications.
* **Dash Bootstrap Components (dbc):** A library of Bootstrap components for Dash.
* **Dash Iconify:** A library for easily using icons from various icon sets in Dash apps.
* **React:** The JavaScript library underlying Dash.

## Prerequisites
* **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
* **pip** (Python package installer) installed.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content if it doesn't exist):
    ```
    dash
    dash-bootstrap-components
    pandas  # If you plan to work with data
    plotly  # If you plan to create charts
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.**
2.  **Run the `app.py` file:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3.  **Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`** (or the address shown in your terminal).

## Configuration

* You can customize the application's appearance by modifying the `assets/style.css` file.
* Temporary constants like logos and the username are located in `components/temp_constants.py`. You should replace these with your actual data or implement a dynamic way to fetch this information.
* The sidebar menu items are defined within the `create_sidebar` function in `components/sidebar.py`. You can easily add, remove, or modify menu items there.
